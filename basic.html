					Tentative title for the chat: hypertext 2020 - where is an expert wikier
					supposed to go in the next decade? But yeah - just rip into what is going to
					be hot techs and paradigms for expert public self-modelers in this future timeline.</p>
					<p>If we get Sphygmus on, Ill do a mic check and then we can start. Hope Im not
					jumping the gun - just pitched this idea today</p>

					<blockquote><p>How would you feel if a decade from now a million people started combing through and <span class="tc-inline-style  link ">deepreading</span> your wiki? </p></blockquote><p>I think that depends on how my wiki has grown in a decade! Perhaps by then I've done something to address the question that gwern poses: <em>"what on this massive highly-interlinked website might I want to start reading?"</em></p><p>I probably wouldn't know that a million people were deepreading my wiki at first. Is there discussion happening about it? Where is the discussion happening? Unless it gets mentioned by us hypertexters, I might miss it (although if it happened in places that send web mentions, I would receive and notice those).</p><p>I expect I would feel overwhelmed and scared at first, then curious to see what people were saying and why they were reading my wiki and what parts of my wiki they were reading, offended at what appears to me as misinterpretations, thrilled at seeing people making new and unexpected connections.</p><hr><p>I know I've been drawn to people who appear to be on a mission because I'm unconsciously hunting for what I perceive them to have  maybe by learning enough from them I learn what piece is missing from me, maybe if I absorb enough of their work the spark will rub off and I'll have a mission too.</p><p>It's hard to imagine being someone who's not hunting for a mission in others but who has found and is pursuing the answer to the point where it spills out so much and attracts others who were where I used to be.</p><p>I'm at the point where writing those paragraphs feels almost like that's just a story I'm still telling myself; that I'm on the brink of <strong>knowing</strong> and <strong>doing</strong>  like I'm telling myself I don't know where I'm going and another part of me is giving me a massive side-eye like <em>yo, really? just stop fibbing because you feel afraid, because of maybe and what if and but I could fail.</em></p><hr><blockquote><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#sphygmus">sphygmus</a>, call it a pile all you want (lmao), but your wiki is a work of art that could virally explode any day (I'm not saying it will, but it could). It's fast, mobile-friendly, intuitively well-structured, approachable, personable, legible, and gorgeous. Instead of being obfuscated and having an offputting barrier to entry, you make a clean entrance for everyone. </p></blockquote><p>Thank you! This is part of why I enjoy engaging with you all like this  so often I'm embedded in what I'm doing that I can't get the perspective to see what I'm doing from a distance. You reflect that back to me and provide me a fresh look. <em>(<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#181222%20%E2%80%93%20weaving%3A%20inside%2Foutside%20meaning">see also</a>)</em></p><blockquote><p>Are you concerned about your association with an insane person like me?</p></blockquote><p>Maybe I should be more concerned than I actually am. Your version of insanity and paranoia is familiar to me, so I've already been resigned to being on one mysterious entity's list or another for a while.</p><blockquote><p>Maybe you should be. I know of at least one person who speaks with me who is a virulent white supremacist who thinks we should kill, punish, or enslave anyone who isn't a cis, white, straight, American male. He can see you!</p></blockquote><p>I often walk past a truck in the parking garage at work with a <em>thin blue line</em> sticker on its rear windshield. Who else at my workplace harbors beliefs similar to the person you mention? I'm probably more in danger from the locals around me than from people who know you.</p><blockquote><p>What do you want my wiki and <span class="tc-inline-style  link ">RGM</span> to become to protect you?</p></blockquote><p>I don't have a good answer to this question. From my perspective, you've already taken the steps that make me feel more protected, and I don't know what else there is to do!</p>

          <p>Part of the solipsistic nature of the wiki is that trolls don't really have much of an effect on it. I don't visit that side of the internet and I'd prefer to keep it that way. It's in public, but I could easily lock it down by using basic authentication or cryptography or whatever.</p><p>I'd like to pre-emptively avoid lumping in "activists" with those types of people. My very existence is political in today's hyperpartisan world, and many of those "activists" are at least attempting to make the world a better place, even if I don't agree with their approach (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Cancel%2FCallout%20Culture">not by half</a>). The only "activists" I'd shit on are those that appropriate the language of activism to perpetuate bigotry, i.e. TERFs and other second-wavers.</p><p>Outside of just, y'know, ignoring them and focusing on my wiki, I exist in a true cozyweb too. 2dl has a gatekeeping system, and beyond that I exist in PMs and the like which (except with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#h0p3">h0p3</a>) generally stay <strong>private</strong> messages. I've thought about starting a group chat, or even private mailing list. I appreciate the notion of staying under wraps. I love that "<a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1" class="tc-tiddlylink-external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark forest</a>" analogy.</p><blockquote><p>I guess my question is: to what degree do you feel the four of us are being shaped by the culture? Or are we attempting to reshape it in miniature?</p></blockquote><p>As much as possible, I want to negate, even escape, the ~culture~. I don't like the mainstream 2010s-now-2020s internet. I hate twitter, I hate facebook, I hate 99% of youtube, I hate instagram, and <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>i hate everyone that posts there.<code>&lt;/s&gt;</code></p><p>If I had my way, we'd all forget the irony-poisoned, toxic, proprietary-software cultural shit-show of today and use the infrastructure we have to replicate and expand on what was good about the past. I want to see an internet which is just about weird, funny shit again. I want communities which are about sharing our love of something, not shitting on what someone else likes, or gatekeeping each other for having insufficiently patrician taste. I want an end to harassment; to reactionary bullying; to corporate shills and #influencers. I want the internet to be fun again.</p>
