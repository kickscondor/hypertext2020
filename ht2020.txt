@kickscondor / 2019-11-29

@sphygmus @chameleon @h0p3 I am going to find some more time over the weekend
to write more - the letters that you are all writing right now have unfolded
new faces and expressions in me - digifaces! I have had a thought tho… I’m
envisioning something - what if we did a groupchat for a certain range of time?

  And we can field questions to the group, answer them in hypertext - and when
  we’re done, I’ll make something out of it. Yes, we sort of do this already, but
  I’m thinking that having a beginning and an ending and a title maybe - could be
  interesting. Ahh, I’m explaining too much - it is just an attempt to branch off
  on the ‘hyperconversations’ game.

  @h0p3 / 2019-11-30 20:31 EST

  Unifying part of the [[hyperconversation]] into one place is cool. I'm curious
  to know if we should synchronize or branch off in how we might represent what
  could be a unified groupchat document like this one. It's not just how we play
  our instruments in the orchestra, but also how we end up remixing and modeling
  what is recorded, right?

    @sphygmus / 2019-11-30

    hehe, I don't think there are any conventions here at all! 😊 So we get to 
    thread our own way through the tapestry.
    
      @h0p3 / 2019-12-01 18:44 EST

      I agree we are making our own sets of conventions here, and I think it's
      awesome that we have the freedom to weave the tapestry from our ends to a
      significant degree.

    Your mentions of "unified/synchronized/branched" makes me think both of
    writing collaboratively in a git repository, branching off and editing and
    merging and so forth; it also makes me think of something like etherpad or a
    shared google doc, with all sorts of realtime possibilities and copy pasty
    mergy smashy version tracking author possibilities. which may not be //the//
    direction, but are possibilities?
    ---
    @h0p3 / 2019-12-01 18:44 EST

    Aye! That is where muh brain is going. We're doing something like that,
    but I don't see how to automate it effectively enough.<<footnote "h:aee"
    "I'm spitballin' here, and I'm way out of my league. Beyond many kinds of
    social conventions, we have to agree to some kinds of technical conventions
    to encode and decode our work to (or sacrifice our autonomy in constructing
    in our preferred conventions). Lots of what makes our hypertext 'just work'
    is that we are all using TW (similarly for my ability to use some insane
    acronym like [[irwartfrr]] with you folks). There are good reasons to seek
    radical diversity here, and there are good reasons to seek one protocol or
    structure. I don't know how to cycle between the two well enough.">> That's
    okay. Maybe we'll find some low-hanging fruit.

    @kickscondor / 2019-12-10

    One of the surprising parts of the chat so far has been that personal
    1-to-1 conversations have emerged and seem to coalesce naturally into the
    rest of the chat!! I expected that we would throw out prompts and everyone
    would respond as a group, like you’d see when a band gets interviewed by a
    magazine, then we would move on to the next batch of prompts.

    But this is almost like a forum with a bunch of panelists who field
    questions, then discuss between each other - except that side conversations
    can happen simultaneously, which would be impossibly noisy in real life.
    (This is a real problem: a panel is not only limited by time, but if a
    certain set of panelists takes the conversation in a new direction, there
    is often no chance - or desire, probably - to return to the original
    question with a new set of panelists.)

    I’m also very heartened that there is so much longform writing occuring. I
    wasn’t sure how everyone would feel comfortable responding. And, if the
    chat is to happen naturally, it shouldn’t be needlessly gimmicky. We don’t
    want to just use hypertext like we’re pressing vinyl records. It should be
    used because it is worthwhile. But it’s like a dream - conversing over a
    broad time span, low-key, exploring each other’s side thoughts, ducking in
    and out of those newly found corridors - and I feel like I am getting to
    know everyone better. I’m bracing myself for a downside here.

      We should set a end date - like end of December? Earlier?

      There should also be a new prompt later this week perhaps. To give the
      group a central point again. Wondering if it should be a new prompt or a
      natural next segue? Maybe both - and if one is ignored, we leave it behind.

    @kickscondor / 2020-02-03

    h0p3’s recent review of a bunch of his previous chats at the end of January
    ([[here|https://philosopher.life/#2020.01.28%20-%20Wiki%20Review%3A%20Big%2C%20Fat%2C%20White%2C%20Nasty%20Smellin'%2C%20Fat%20Bitch]]
    and
    [[here|https://philosopher.life/#2020.01.29%20-%20Wiki%20Review%3A%20Oompa%20Loompa%20Body%2C%20Ass%20Bitch]],
    for instance) is amazing. It’s such a subtle thing - but these kinds of
    chats would be thought of as ‘ephemeral’ on any other blog or wiki. But
    what he’s doing is prepping them for longevity. I wonder what he feels he
    was able to shake out of them by running through them again. (It’s
    impressive how long his notes are - it shows how deep his feelings run for
    all of these people, I think.)

    I especially like his notes on his [[quite
    short|https://philosopher.life/#2019.11.18%20-%20Sphygmus%3A%20Mismatches]] chat with
    Sphygmus. In a way, these notes form an extended ‘thank you’ for reporting
    some technical issues. It’s cool that she knows his process that well -
    she’s actually reported some things to me as well. Gah, I have a real soft
    spot (like the soft spot in an infant’s developing skull - in fact, it’s in
    the same place!) for observant people.

  where it goes! also excited at the thought of collaborating on words & seeing
  what you make out of them.
  ---
  @h0p3 / 2019-12-01

  I’m excited to learn how to write in this format. I’d prefer to think inside
  this tiddler, but it takes a while for a message to settle sometimes, so
  please wait until I have a timestamp and ‘draft’ lock is dropped before
  quoting me.
  ---
  @kickscondor / 2019-12-01 / stenos/hypertext-2020:-metachat/

  Just to set you at ease, nothing will be finalized until the chat is over.
  So I won’t begin wrapping it up until everyone has pulled their stuff out of
  ‘draft’. Yes, this gives you a chance to edit yourself and mess with old
  chats - I’m not sure what you all think about the ethic of that - but I’m
  great with that, we can accomplish more if we trust each other.

  As for quoting you while you’re drafting - since we’re all drafting, too,
  it seems fair game, right? As long as we source YOUR final quotes from YOUR
  finalized wiki, right? And if certain quotes don’t add up, we’ll footnote
  it and maybe it’ll add to the fun of the sprawl.

    Many of the ‘features’ of hyperconversations (drafting in public, heavy
    footnotes, branching discussion, more-is-more) seem to be attempts to break
    through possible communication problems by providing an excess of
    communication to draw from or to replicate the kinds of real-life
    annotations (body language, grunts, pointing at things) that we give
    in-person conversation. When someone is drafting a letter publicly and
    recants some words - or an emotional sentence evolves from reflexive
    disgust or confusion to a sentence of rationality - you catch a peek at the
    mind, much like you might in the corner of someone’s eye.

    So, since hyperconversations continue to push toward an attempt at a
    ‘transparent’ view of someone’s side of a conversation or an early
    revelation at their motives<<footnote "bw" "I’ve gotten this sense during
    some of my hyper-Cs that we all lay our cards down face-up on the table
    (as best you can I guess) and then work backwards from there.">> - I’m going
    to lay out some of my intentions for doing this chat and everyone can fix me
    from there.

    One of my main goals from the start is to see what editing and human
    curation can bring to a chat (or threaded discussion). While formulating
    [[Notes: We’ve Got Blog (2002)|/stenos/we%27ve-got-blog]], I noticed that
    one of the prevailing notions of the book was that blogging //improved// on
    journalism (and presumably op-eds) by simply removing editors and publishers
    from the process and letting the audience decide what is good.

    But this reasoning does not hold up - blogging doesn’t simply make
    everyone’s writing better. (It would be harder, right? New medium?) Sure,
    it may produce more public writing, with some very high quality at the top
    end - but someone still has to weed through it all - and that’s a tough job
    that most people don’t want or know how to do in their spare time!<<footnote
    "still" "It’s also terribly ironic to me that, given the constant lauding of
    blogging as ascendant in //We’ve Got Blog//, they still chose to edit and
    curate an anthology of blogposts.">>

    I have a hunch that there could be some remaining value in weeding through a
    hypertext conversation and polishing it, as a service to readers. I don’t
    see myself removing any of it - I think the job could be to simply highlight
    parts of it into a running conversation, moving the rest out of view, but
    still accessible. I don’t think all readers will appreciate this - some will
    want (and deserve) the raw text. But I think having an initially truncated
    version to read can help the reader get into it a bit easier and help them
    decide if they want the full dump.

      This also seems to tap into some design skills - and I think it’s possible
      that an editor/designer hybrid craft could come out of a project like this.

    @h0p3 / 2019-12-01

    You are picking out what is [[salient]], right? You are instrumentally
    reducing and abstracting for the sake of something. You are modeling what
    you perceive with some purpose in mind. Like my mind, to some [[dok]], my
    wiki allows me to re-use my data to understand what is [[salient]] in the
    world (including myself). Unlike my mind, to some [[dok]], my public wiki
    allows almost anyone to re-use my data to understand what is [[salient]] in
    the world (including myself).<<footnotes "h" "Which is the hardly the claim
    it's terribly useful to most people.">>

    [[^polished^]]
    
    What is the [[gfwiwcgws]] of thinking, experiencing, modeling, including
    [[PSM]] as just an aspect? Why do I want to know the truth about myself and
    the world? What is understanding [[good]] for? Well, that's exactly what I'm
    trying to find and explain (which is hardly to say I'm good at it).
    [[Hope]]fully, it is part of the most meaningful search for meaning
    available to at least me.
    
    [[^instead^]]

    One of the reasons I'm a real piece of work to have in Sunday School with ya
    (in a way, you are asking me to engage in [[Prompted Introspection]]) is
    that at least 50% of the time the answer is Jesus (DUUHHHNNNN! Can't top
    that shit), and that's analogously what I answer like a jackass. Imagine
    having a math test where you know the answer to every problem is 42 (that's
    the kind of math test I would give if I taught math, lol...that's basically
    what I do when I give tests in symbolic logic), but the whole point of the
    test was showing your work (by doing the work, something is earned,
    habituated, and written into me; it is a profound exercise of autonomy). I
    keep almost mindlessly answering: 42 or 42ness, which is almost vacuously
    true, but I'm still not showing my work well enough to you. I'm trying, lol.
    You have every right to ask me to continue to pragmatize my answer in my
    philosophical dojo (and vv).

    Once again, thank you for listening to a madman ramble.
    `/hands-you-a-bucket-of-rotten-tomatoes`. Do what needs to be done, homie.
    XD.
    ---
    @kickscondor / 2019-12-03

    I think this is probably your most useful analogy to helping me comprehend
    self-modeling. (Trying to show 42ness.) This goes in the final.

  that you are [[Making It Explicit|https://www.amazon.com/Making-Explicit-Representing-Discursive-Commitment/dp/0674543300#customerReviews]]
  with me.">>; I don't want to dump directly into
  [[@: hypertext 2020]].<<footnotes "s" "So far, it looks like a microcosm to
  me, a shared focal point, or a shared neuron with a clearer ground zero for
  where our interpretations attempt to meld and branch off.">> I'm not convinced
  I ought.

  Perhaps this is an example of the broader principle in action. I signaled a
  preference about drafting while drafting, and it was overridden quite
  reasonably, with an explanation and justification to boot.  

    [[You|kickscondor]] have my trust, [[Root User]]. The people outside of
    [[@: hypertext 2020]] (for example, the people who may read this a decade
    from now) do not, or at least not nearly to the same [[dok]]. Being public,
    and being who I am, I have my work cut out for me to justifiably withstand
    the possibility of intense scrutiny.<<footnotes "w" "Questions a [[PSM]]
    must ask themselves: what am I willing to die for? What am I willing to be
    persecuted for? Sometimes, that's just what [[faith]] is, and those
    {[[axioms]]} are part of what we are really made of.">>

  One of the reasons I feel I have some license to draft and why I'm partially
  comfortable with you quoting my drafts is that I do my best to keep snapshots.
  There's something to hold onto there for rigorous interpretation. This is also
  part of why I offer a real-time sync and minutely diff. While I'm pretty awful
  at providing context, there's still a curve in there to think about. I
  anticipate that someone can ask, "Hey, you changed your mind; why would you
  do that?". I don't always have control over my guts (I often have to puke
  them up and think about them), but I do have some control over how I'm going
  to reason about my feelings and what I'm going to do about them. You have the
  chance to reason about whether or not I'm trying to do the best I can with my
  pile of puke.

    @kickscondor / 2019-12-03

    Hahah! We’re all standing around examining each other’s sick. I like this
    interpretation. I think that if people could begin with this image, use it
    as the basis for their consensus, they can admirably proceed with the
    dialectic. There’s a lot less picking things apart if you cut the whole
    conversation some slack. (//But I’m also glad that you asked me to
    clarify - and that you dug into the response - sure, why not? It’s all
    doodoo - but still worth rooting in, on the chance of some swallowed
    gems…//)

  I realize I may be quoting a draft quoting a draft here. XD. They aren't
  easy lines to draw, no doubt. [[As I said|@: hypertext 2020]], I'm still
  feeling out the fitting conventions here. I'm hesitant to directly quote
  drafts, but I agree it is necessary sometimes. I suppose it can be useful
  to cite a draft as such where appropriate (your guess is as good as mine).
  I also think linking to the source can sometimes iron out these wrinkles.

  I'm okay that it isn't finalized in some sense. Syntax and some metadata
  considerations aren't big deals to me. I [[hope]] we'll come back and
  re-interpret the sequence yet again (still seems like a continuation of the
  original sequence). I do try to leave content untouched eventually. My
  [[CDR]] logs tend to be relaxed. After a weekly audit (during
  [[Family Time]]), and even moreso after a [[Monthly Audit]], I'd like to
  think that part of the clay has somewhat hardened. Sometimes I add
  Retroactive [[Footnotes]], and other times I simply link to it and keep
  building. 

  Commitment is a process, hardly one I've understood and mastered well
  enough.

  I like that structure, and I'm curious to see how it should grow. My followup
  suggestion is tentative, especially because it doesn't point well enough
  (probably either requiring an extension in TW5 or transclusions, but I'm fine
  searching even if it might be visually simpler to have the kinds of trees we
  see in a Reddit-like forum). I'm happy to follow whatever conventions are
  most suitable here.

@h0p3 / 2019-12-01 18:44 EST

anyone //better// understand it.<<footnote "h:bst" "I'm convinced it is not

how to better generalize in a few words what I'm doing in my work ("it's
[[h0p3]]'s wiki" is kinda lame). How does one pick out what is most
[[salient]]? 

What do you think is an adequate shorthand for what we are each doing?
---
@kickscondor / 2019-12-01

An adequate shorthand to describe you, your wiki, your work there. I feel
like the phrase was an attempt to wrap all of that up into a shorter name so
that you can refer to it briefly - and perhaps so people can understand from
a glimpse. Or even so you can understand or remind yourself of what you are
doing.

So, my first question is just to look at the phrase again. Seems like a good
starting point. Is it that to you? Where does it function today?

* * *

As additional material - ‘public self-modeling’ is a phrase that
chameleon has had fun with and I’m not sure to what extent it is a meme for
her or if it is quite serious or what. On the other hand, Sphygmus has
[[said|https://sphygm.us/#190921%20%E2%80%93%20Log%3A%20self-representation]]
a few months ago (referencing this word) that her wiki is “not an attempt to
answer the question of who I am.” So, I guess I also wonder if “self-modeling”
is a quest to answer who you are or if it is something else."
---
@chameleon / 2019-12-12 03:18 CST

All things are memes, all things are serious. I mock that which I care about,
sometimes, because that's how I know I can really care.

Well, I think I'm just irony poisoned by too much time on social media and chans
and that's made me prone to joking about things I'm serious about, or taking a
mocking tone at all times. To me PSM-ing is serious work, I just like to laugh
at myself on occasion. I didn't write
[[Lol chameleon|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Lol%20chameleon]] just for a lark.

To maybe echo a sentiment from your last letter, kicksy-kun, the whole internet
thing is a fun little giggle ;)

this wiki (like an [[arrogant]] fool, surely). Awful as it is: [[Root]] is still
the best representation of what I'm doing in this wiki. Even in shambles:
{[[About]]}, {[[Principles]]}, [[Lifetime Projects]], and [[Readme]] point to
what I'm doing in this wiki and why as well as I know how (though it's barely
readable, I realize). I have to iterate and grow them, and even my chronological
linking to them tells a story ([[ITS]]). Of course, I think we each have a
different path to take here to some [[dok]], and mine merits profound ridicule,

  asks the barista. “What would you recommend?” asks Socrates. “I would go with
  the pumpkin spice latte,” says the barista. “Why?” asks Socrates. “It’s
  seasonal,” she answers. “But why exactly is a seasonal drink better than a
  non-seasonal drink?” “Well,” said the barista, “I guess it helps to connect
  you to the rhythm of the changing seasons.” “But do you do other things to
  connect yourself to that rhythm?” asked Socrates. “Like wear seasonal
  clothing? Or read seasonal books? If not, how come it’s only drinks that are
  seasonal?” “I’m not sure,” says the barista. “Think about it,” says Socrates,
  and leaves without getting anything.">> appears to be at least part of the
  treadmill of generating our models, and they ought to be. Our brains are
  constantly modeling the world (including ourselves); there'd be no intentional
  consciousness without it. 

    @kickscondor / 2019-12-24

    I may think something is wonderful in the ‘now’ but that could change. (//I
    try to resist that, though - and to always be grateful for the things I’ve
    loved from the past. This helps me to guarantee that I will always love
    philosopher.life!//)

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      I'm confused, and I am certainly missing crucial lego pieces here. Thank
      you for crafting this. I would beg for clarification, but I do not wish you
      to waste your breath on me when it may be more important for you to simply
      breathe.

    But I can’t always nab (in the instant) why I love
    something.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      I would argue this is true to some [[dok]] at any level in any of our
      contexts (for both love and like). I beg you forgive me for being so
      high-pressure, dark, heavy, and straight-up mean in wrestling for
      cognitive articulations of this. I am often a poor judge of what you are
      capable of achieving in your circumstances (again, I am a poor modeler),
      and you should feel free to hold me accountable for failing to be
      fittingly hedged-conservative here (and elsewhere).

    And I feel that even attempting to can be foolhardy.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      I can agree that sometimes it can be foolhardy, and not just in the sense
      that the odds of succeeding are sometimes low, nor simply because it can
      be imprudent at times, but also because it can be wrong to pursue in some
      contexts. There is a give and a take here, and we must take breaks from
      cognitive grinds to maintain our sanity. I'm absurd in this space.

    In the
    moment, I can usually only assemble a tiny LEGO flower of an impression.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      Your words echo through time to me. I do not know what you mean well
      enough. Sir David Hume speaks of impressions and passions. He thinks
      there are only impressions, but I think you make a very Kantian move in
      claiming to assemble the impression, to impose your modeling on it. I
      also think it speaks to a recognition of having at least a tiny amount of
      [[power]] in autonomously shaping what you perceive of the
      thing-in-itself.

      I'm egregious here. I ask questions that are impossible to answer all
      day. I do not mean to hinder your cultivation of flowers and impressions
      in a way that is not useful to you.

    And it often seems better to hold off and try to assemble something more.
    Although: flowers are dainty and beautiful in their own right and I can
    still later surround them with LEGO cabbages and LEGO motorcycles and
    minotaurs and to build the fine scenery that I mean to.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      This is a hard problem. I have no idea what to say about it. I don't
      think the work ever ends, but you need to take breaks, dally, diffuse,
      bask, and live in the moment, too. How to pick that out wisely is a
      virtue far beyond me.

    And I also think that my LEGO flower (in this case) would be the phrase, “I
    love it because it makes my life worth living.” And to avoid the rational
    dissection of it is to grant it real life for the moment.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      I appreciate that. I'm trying to demonstrate to you that I get that,
      [[kicks]]condor. I'm a dumb hammer, and everything is a nail to me.
      Perhaps you will have to help me wield me, Dasein. I don't know how to be
      instrumental enough to you. I am often the wrong tool for flower-making,
      but sometimes I come in handy for pinning them and arranging the LEGO
      vases.

      Even the rational parts of who we are must learn to respect the
      irrational parts of who we are, and vice versa. I don't know how to
      fittingly pull back enough to know [[W5H]] to pull back and cognize about
      what I'm feeling, nor how to fittingly curl up enough to know [[W5H]] to
      curl up and escape what I'm thinking. There is an ethic to bridging what
      Heidegger calls the ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand. I am obviously
      profoundly convinced that cognition is an indispensable half of the
      [[Self-Dialectic]]. I take you to be saying the same.

    (//Of course, I’m not opposed to the conversation with Socrates, I would
    have it in an instant//. “Because drinks are more seasonal to me,” I say to
    him. “Drinks can’t be //more// seasonal,” he says, “because they have no
    seasons.” I say, “Oh yes, they do. They hover right above the liquid…”)

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      Your anecdote sounds like thinking and feeling to me. I can't say for
      sure. The subjectivity of existence, how it feels, and how it appears to
      me: to my best knowledge, these are real attributes of my relationship to
      the other and hence the thing-in-itself. It is difficult to not feel what
      you are feeling in the moment (arguably impossible in most cases), and it
      is likewise difficult to think about what you are feeling (arguably
      extremely painful in most cases).

      Dissociation, perhaps functionally embedded in every living fiction to
      some [[dok]], is morally obligated and perfectly rational in many kinds
      of cases. Likewise, after sufficient reason, sometimes one's feelings are
      the sole reason of justification available to us, the remaining
      definition.

      I told you once that my wife is deathly allergic to morphine; the
      painkiller took her life after she was burned alive. She could not have
      morphine for her agony (nor for the years of pain and grief that
      followed). Anesthetics and painkillers, at least [[phenomenologically]],
      do some kind of dissociative work in blocking out part of reality. After
      killing and reviving her (itself a trauma), there were no partial
      measures they could give the 13yo girl. Complete dissociation was the
      only medicine available. Ketamine, mountains of it from what I can tell;
      it permanently altered her. Even though she can barely remember it, all
      she can remember of 1989 is pain and skin grafts. She has spent a
      lifetime feeling and reasoning about the dichotomy between the
      meaninglessness and the meaning of suffering. 

      It's here that [[The Other]] is always fundamentally autistic. Lastly, I
      think it's a matter of stop and go progress. I hope you wisely enjoy the
      reality of your seasonal drink and bouquets of fiery flowers.

  I agree even the possibility of wonderful people (and other things in virtue
  of them) are fundamental to what makes life worth living. 

  What makes a person wonderful "to me" is not necessarily what makes a person
  wonderful. Likewise, what makes life worth living "to me" and what makes it
  objectively worth living are not identical; I can only hope to try to wisely
  close the gap. I agree that sentiments of "this is worth it to me" are a
  fundamental part of the objective calculation of what actually makes it worth
  it. One can be wrong about what makes life worth living though, which is why
  continued clarification is necessary; we are obligated to attempt to improve
  our understanding of what makes life worth living and what counts as
  "wonderful."<<footnote "h:tfe" "I suggest wonderful things can obtain even if
  there's no one there to think they are wonderful.">>

  Even though I agree your instinct, intuition, and sentiment (and their
  development or inspiration) are necessary, that doesn't make them sufficiently
  justified.<<footnote "h:tsj" "The 'because I said so' parental cliche is not a
  strong argument. The ultimate reasons 'why' aren't competely inherent to any
  particular agent's point of view.">> There can be a difference between what
  you want and what you should want. Godwin's Law: what makes Hitler's
  sentiments about what matters (including what makes his life worth living)
  objectively wrong in some cases? Is it simply because he doesn't value what I
  value? Why should we be prevented from asking him to clarify not just what it
  means for him to say "this is worth it to me," but also "why should it be
  worth it to him?" We are hitting the paradox of tolerance here, and we have to
  think about how to justify intolerance. At the very least, it requires
  democratically mapping and weighing all of our instincts (though that itself
  is seeking objective evaluation). Part of the issue is that we don't obviously
  have a moral right to be just any version of ourselves. We don't own ourselves
  all the way down, including our epistemic justifications. We actually owe
  things to others (duties and rights correspond, and ownership is defined by
  clusters of those relationships), though that may be what you are trying to
  get at in living for "wonderful people" here. First-personally, justice is at
  least fairness in negotiating between what is valuable "to me" (whatever the
  self is) and "to others."

  Some people think of philosophy as a form of therapy. There is a kind of peace
  which one might achieve by no longer asking "why" or stoically minimizing
  desires. Some might go so far as to say the only solution is to dissolve the
  belief there was a problem at all. 

  Lastly, the brain has evolved to be a probabilistic inference machine that
  seeks energy-efficient modeling (those specimens tend to be more likely to
  survive).<<footnote "h:nts" "Interestingly, the experience of time may be
  related to the amount of energy necessary to compute what is novel, and on a
  view like Heidegger's, we're trying to escape thinking about the world, as
  though the evolutionary pursuit of energy-efficiency pushes consciousness to
  seek eliminating itself.">> One energy-efficient filter, inference, or
  instinct about value is to say it matters because I say it matters, and leave
  it at that. Conversely, one could be chemically addicted to continually trying
  to ask and answer "why."

  It’s as if you’ve spread a giant sheet of graph paper before you on the
  floor—and have begun to box and triangulate your aspects, to map out yourself.
  And, to anyone watching (and why would they watch? well, hell, if I saw
  someone mapping out on a giant self-o-graph in the campus quad, I think I’d
  stop to see) they’ll see the places where they map onto you, or where their
  points go near or interweave. You have your own handwriting and flourishes of
  decorative arrows and bullets. And those discoveries made in the mundane and
  detailed, knotty parts of the graph could be surprising—these lines are all
  pathways of experience. Who knows which are the most vaunted.

The analogy of laying out graph paper and working on a map to what I'm doing in
my wiki resonates strongly with me. Bits of myself on this mountain here, bits
of myself in that valley there: of course I think about this a lot in relation
to [[Placeness]] and [[Embodiment]]. If we sometimes emulate the physical world
in a mental mind palace to enhance our memory, this wiki feels like it might be
my mental states laid out in some sort of "physical" space.

On the one hand, there are my journal logs. On the other hand, there are my
subject matter logs. Keeping multiple wikis or multiple web pages for different
subjects appears to be one approach that people take: maybe the most common
approach? Perhaps it's confusing to stumble upon a website where everything is
mashed together -- the mundane details of what I ate yesterday right alongside
finished letters, notes on projects, and my drafting of this response.

Artisan, craftsperson, geographer -- I think h0p3 essentially sums up an overall
desire in his [[introduction|https://philosopher.life/#Sphygmus]].<<footnote
"wd" "would that I had the skill at recognizing and translating people so well
for them!">> In the conceptual/formal realm of my school's art department:
artists find a problem or question interesting and do research on it; find
different ways of approaching it; think up experiments and run them; develop a
structured or intuitive process; and so forth. Art becomes the science of
approaching creation as conceptual exploration.

In some sense this is the problem with writing an artist statement -- ugh, I
didn't like the school assignment to write an artist statement. (Now I want to
go find whatever I wrastled up and submitted for it.) How can I write an artist
statement when I don't even know what I'm doing myself? I haven't pinned it down
or figured it out -- just wandering, and I'm not sure it means anything to
anyone.

Perhaps it's about feeling -- when the wind is warm but just a little sharp,
and blows that feeling of longing straight through your bones -- if one
empathizes with that feeling, resonates with it, then perhaps they'll feel
themselves in a little bit of my wiki as well.

  @kickscondor / 2019-12-03

  (//First off - great quotes! The low-key Nadia quote is unexpected, but very
  refreshing//.)

  I actually think your wiki is an ‘artist statement’ without needing to
  explicitly state that - and I think that’s why h0p3 could capture your
  essence so clearly. Maybe he inferred it from all the pieces?

  @sphygmus / 2019-12-08

  I feel like my wiki is where I get to throw all my sick at the wall and see

  feel like it, I can use it to research myself and connect the dots to form
  some larger picture (hopefully). It's wonderful to be able to ''easily''
  check on what I wrote on this exact same day last year, to see what was going
  on inside my head. Repeating myself here -- it's more dynamic and alive than
  the text that's currently locked inside my paper journals.

I take it that you don't see yourself as a [[PSM]], [[kicks]]. Is that fair to
say?
---
@kickscondor / 2019-12-03

Yeah, I see myself more as a conduit. I really get into finding people and
connecting people (and saying hi to them). I don’t have a desire to preserve
myself or to catalog myself. But having the dialetic does make some of that
worthwhile. And maybe I do model myself in other ways: in pixels, in code, in
colors flickering.

  @h0p3 / 2019-12-06 22:05 EST

  I can appreciate the conduit metaphor. I like to think you add weight in how
  things are picked out and transferred, maybe more like a neuron (which is
  arguably a conduit of sorts).

I mean - you’ve all influenced me a lot and I find myself mimicking some of
your conventions. This leads me to think that part of PSM-ing helps a human
function day-to-day. (Talking through, remembering, clarifying thoughts.)

  I wish I understood better whether ‘modeling’ meant a self-‘styling’,
  self-‘bending’, self-‘constructing’ vs just trying to represent yourself as
  you are, ‘the plain picture’
  [[in Bob Dylan’s meaning|https://youtu.be/mnl5X5MQKTg?t=104]]. Maybe it’s all
  of it, somewhere between, or simply not possible. Are we modeling fictional
  characters or not? Does it matter?

    going to need to breathe deeply, but for different reasons. You must
    counsel me otherwise, sir. Tell me to remove my hokey hand or my trite
    eyes, and I will.

  Maybe you need to define fiction further for me. It may come in [[dok]]. It
  seems like the relationship between author intentions and reader
  interpretations may define fiction in context. This is not an area I
  understand nearly well enough.

  Insofar as imaginary characters pop up in our [[phenomenology]], we are
  modeling imaginary characters who are a part of who we are. Humor, irony,
  counterfactuals, hypothetical reasoning, rhetoric, and imagination all seem to
  have fictional elements to them; all of those are part of my modeling. Even
  proofs in classical logic rely upon the absurd, particularly in [subproofs,
  stages, or layers], to eventually point us to the truth. In some cases, we are
  forced to model things we don't mean in order to model the things we do. We
  also might think of choice as modeling who we could be, generating a set of
  fictional characters, and selecting from them. I'm open to the claim models
  always have something fictional about them insofar as we pretend they are the
  things-in-themselves. Bohr's model or Newtonian physics might be fictions in
  a sense, but they act as intuition pumps and provide the initial kernel
  material over which we can iterate and bootstrap a more accurate model too.

  Do I think the "self" is a fiction? It depends. We can be wrong about who we
  are because there is an objective "who we are."<<footnote "h:hyd" "How you
  define yourself is not who you are, but only a part of it.">> Who we think we
  are (including our own modeling of the world) might be fictional in some
  sense, but the gap between who we think we are and who we actually are is not
  fictional (though it seems even that gap is built into "who we are"). Who we
  are can only be understood through dialectics with others, and at least
  sometimes that occurs through dialectics with imagined characters. Of course,
  certainty cannot be achieved,<<footnote "h:cba" "If justified certainty is the
  absolute standard for knowledge, then we cannot know if we are modeling
  fictional characters.">> and any time you posit a limit, you posit something
  beyond it. <<footnote "h:sbi" "and what is beyond that limit is sometimes only
  something which fiction can initially explore">>

    [[^now^]]

    If I //sought// after your model, I couldn’t achieve it ‘now’,

    LEGO castle.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      I agree there is something crucial about "now." The relationship between
      one's immediate lived conscious experience and one's [[4DID]] is not one
      I understand well enough (nor can I, I would argue). They are each
      necessary for the other's significance. I cannot decouple that
      dependency. They appear both inseparable and distinct. What it means for
      one to empathize with [[The Other]] is the task of the autonomous self.
      Can we change ourselves long-term? Yes; it stands to reason, though:
      there are sacrificially violent costs at times (and in both directions).
      The [[infinigress]]es of desire satisfaction and suffering sometimes only
      beget more suffering in some cases. I'm a grotesque and foolish monster
      here, and I am sorry.

      [[^sliver^]]

      I agree that I cannot, either ([[fff]] by definition); we can only get
      closer to increasingly fit models of the thing-in-itself. Part of the
      problem is that we cannot hold a hyperobject in our focus all at once
      (and, generally, the term is reserved for being well beyond the extreme
      limits of one's focus), which is why we are lossy empirical creatures.
      While I do not have certain proof: I suggest it is also why we must
      iteratively diffuse and lose focus of it as a means to improving our
      focus over time (it reminds me of falling asleep and waking up again,
      packing and unpacking, [[faith]] in continuity and change, my ignorance
      of limits, and the meaning beyond the bottom of proofs).

    But what I wonder is: are the old models relevant to the ‘now’ model?

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      Yes, to varying [[dok]]. The truth matters objectively, though it doesn't
      always matter to the subject so clearly, distinctly, directly, or
      completely (and, there is a difference between description and
      prescription here). Relevant in what way? There are many cases in which
      directly trying to model the past in the present is not the fitting use
      of one's ray of intentionality (nor to various parts which comprise or
      give rise to it). That doesn't make the old completely irrelevant to the
      new or the now, though it may sometimes feel that way.

    Can I render all models useless in an instant?

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      Useless [[to what|gfwiwcgws]]? Can you make it appear useless to you, as
      one might perceive and wield it in the 'now'? Yes. To varying [[dok]],
      sometimes that rendering is up to us, and sometimes it is not. It is not
      easy to know what is up to us, and that's part of what makes rendering
      what matters a hard problem.

    Perhaps, in modeling, I look
    back and see the model of me - and suddenly want nothing to do with it.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      Sometimes you should have as little to do with it to various [[dok]] as
      you can, and insofar as it is up to you, it is rational not to have
      anything to do with it in that particular [[dok]]. The unknown contingent
      space of that timeslice is something you must wisely determine.

    Or perhaps it’s more light-hearted than that - it’s time for a drastic change.
    Or I’m just embarassed - that seems likely!

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      You sound like Saint Frankl to me, [[kicks]]. I sometimes wonder if, or
      [[W5H]] and to what [[dok]] (and what it means to say): there is some
      heavy-hearted/minded tradeoff cost to the light-hearted/minded, and vv. 

    I’m not suggesting that the models are flawed - to all the people I know who
    have gone through the death of many family members at once, this model
    becomes quite precious. For the memories it holds, but also because you
    don’t want to lose who you are through the process. You rely on the history
    of yourself to help you not lose yourself to an internally destructive
    force that wants to kill you.

    But then - there are things from ourselves that we can’t take with us
    always. Ideas become outdated, of course. And then, like losing someone who
    we’ve had plans with, who suddenly is gone, any of our plans or projects
    might not survive in the present.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      I'm sorry. I can sit here quietly, babble nervously, or search for a way
      to take your mind off it. You pick. I don't want to directly nitpick here
      without you telling me to do so. This place is radioactive. At the very
      least, I hope it does not cause cancer, and beyond my dreams, I hope a
      good mutation emerges. Even if I'm not bleeding out, I am lost in the
      desert here.

    This also relates to the discussion about clarifying ‘wonderful’.

      @h0p3 / 2019-12-25

      Indeed, it does. I appreciate your willingness to attempt to clarify this
      for me. This must have been a very costly thing to say; it feels like an
      exceptionally heavy meteorite to me. I hope you will one day forgive me
      for failing to be the surgical listener and virtuous interlocutor you
      need.

    Fuck, dude. Yeah, plain as day, you found the words just fine. I am
    listening, despite the fact that I'm a retarded brute. Ignore my broken
    thoughts, feeling, or questions for clarification at will, please. Like a
    donkey of a Donqui, I'm racing in and out to find a working model for you.
    I have no talent for weaving the necessary bandages, but I will try. I wish
    I knew how to graft my own skin onto your wounds. I don't know how to bear
    what cannot be fixed well enough either.

    I am convinced that [[Self-Dialectics]] are hard problems. Even in the
    pursuit of peace in both now and [[other]]wise, you will sometimes be at
    war with yourself or yourselves, in various parts and [[dok]]. I'm
    fundamentally unqualified to speak about many aspects of what it means for
    that to be precious, and I'm certain of that. You obviously know that well
    beyond what either of us can articulate.

    I also have so little room to talk about what I take to be an internally
    destructive force (a part, a process) that wants to kill, sever, or be free
    of an outer whole. I'm not qualified, and I don't know anyone who is. Even
    as a feeling and raw desire, how does one reconstructively respond to
    deconstruction [[irwartfrr]]? No doubt, there is a time and a place in
    which one must forego attempting to reason with unreason. But, you are
    correct, it requires a memory, data, a model, to have the material with
    which to be constructive in handling and processing that force. You
    obviously know that well beyond what either of us can articulate.

    Do I think you live in a unique hell sometimes? Yeah, always. This is a
    deep part of the ocean; if you deem it necessary, you may need to breathe
    from my tank before we can reach the surface (sorry about my filthy
    mouthpiece and sharply disgusting air). I wish I knew how to be calm in
    that chaos. I am the wrong person for you, [[kicks]]. You require healing
    so far beyond me, that I'm terrified I'm pointlessly hurting you in just
    asking to listen to you (let alone talking with you about it).

    I don't know well enough what it means for parts of us to die, nor [[W5H]]
    to engage or accept it wisely enough. What does it mean to cooperate,
    negotiate, and work with this destructive force? I do not know.

  Yes, it matters who we are, especially since what matters about who we are
  can't be solely defined by us. It matters [[W5H]] we attempt to represent
  ourselves, and fiction matters at least with respect to how it serves reality.
  If I recognize it as such, I try to ask myself, "What is this fiction for?"
  The purpose of fiction is part of its meaning.

@chameleon / 2019-12-04 20:58 CST

I started the wiki out of writer's block on my blog, and it quickly grew into
something I actually had fun working on. But what it's //for// is an
interesting question.

The subtitle is "things chameleon knows" and I feel like that encapsulates it.
To me this is a website to throw my ideas to the wall and see what sticks.
It's obviously not every last thing I know, but it covers a broad spectrum of
my interests and ideas.
---
@kickscondor / 2019-12-10

Yes, this seems like ‘self-modeling’. Keep going. Why do it publicly?
---
@chameleon / 2019-12-12 03:18 CST

It's fun. It lets people see what I'm working on, and thus opens collaboration
opportunities ([[Zodai|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Zodai]] and I have already toyed
with this, outside of our little clique). And more than a little emulation/hero
worship. I'm young and romantic at heart and like to copy things that my
[[Senpai|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Senpai]]s do.

@sphygmus With h0p3, I think I am more curious about the ‘self-modeling’ part of the
phrase - but with you I definitely wonder more about the ‘public’ part. It
sounds like you’re looking for kindred
spirits.

  But you also keep a lot of things private - and you do explain this
  from a curatorial angle:

  Perhaps it’s confusing to stumble upon a website where everything is
  mashed together — the mundane details of what I ate yesterday right
  alongside finished letters, notes on projects, and my drafting of this response.

  How do you decide what to reveal and what to make public? (I ask because
  I haven’t resolved this for myself either - whereas I think h0p3 has made
  this line very easy for himself.)<<footnote "k:[2]" "This also seems very
  pertinent to the question of ‘public self-modeling’, since h0p3 begins
  defining this phrase by exhorting people to ‘deprivatize’ themselves. ">>

^polished^ I'm not handing you simply some
polished product; I'm handing you the chain of [evidence, custody, and
contexts], as soup to nuts as I can (the residue buried timelapsed-art is
also a product). I think it's also deeply concerned with method, finding
ways to cooperate in this radically hard problem, and learning how to
autonomously construct our own processes, including fairly calculating a
model of [[The End]].

@kickscondor / 2019-12-03

This is a great point! I forget that you are already employing a lot of
self-editing and self-curating. (And what you do with us - making a
tiddler for Sphygmus that curates her, in a way.) So this is starting to
lead into my next prompt, what you refer to here as ‘the chain’
(but which I also think of as hypertext ‘layers’)… let me think how to
articulate this and I’ll get back to you. ‘Soup to nuts’ is one way of putting
it, but it’s imprecise, it’s not just a linear progression toward ‘the end’ -
or it doesn’t have to be, I guess.

  I just - I keep trying to figure out what the point behind social media is, or
  why we should use it, if we should use it at all...what purpose is it serving
  us?

  though - the question of "what good is social media to our society and
  humankind in general?" is not the same as the question "what good is social
  media to me?" the latter is really what's subjectively important to me, right?
  what are my feelings about it? does it make me feel good, or inspired, or
  dragged down? etc.

  I think right now, it feels like information overload. at least the
  consumption part. Especially since school started, I'm about at my maximum
  info processing capability right now.

  anyway I suppose there's some things to feel through here. because I don't
  need to have my feelings all figured out before I take action - that's the
  imperfect action. and there's 100% fear there, both the fear that someone will
  interact with me, and that nobody will, at the same time.

  @sphygmus / 2018-10-07 / 181007%20%E2%80%93%20Sphygmus%3A%20Auditing%3B%20draft

  emptying out my links from my phone into my wiki made me feel information
  overload; but it seems to be linked to lacking a meaningful paradigm through
  which to make sense of the information? I see my wiki as helping with that -
  were I to go through my old journals, I think the search for salience would
  help transition it from feeling overwhelming to good/right/meaningful. With my
  wiki I'm starting to trace my steps through hyperspace and write down my
  thoughts as I go - not just sponging info but taking an active role in
  thinking about it? like - almost prioritizing writing down my thoughts, rather
  than reading the most links.

  ...Because we all can read the same thing and we'll all get different things
  out of it and connect it to our individual experiences and - //fuck. yes.//
  this is the solution to the "information overload," right?! to encourage
  people in building their own meaningful structures out of all the material
  around us?! ''this feels so right.'' and being able to hop into someone else's
  meanings and read them and then link them into your own - networks of
  individual meanings?

  p. 12. “For everyone, the great task of the future will not be to gain access
  to more information, but to develop avenues to information that genuinely
  enhances our understanding, and to screen out the rest.” //(Yes, ok, here we
  go. I think we can all agree with this. And this makes me think of the
  ‘layers’ I mentioned in Notes: We’ve Got Blog (2002) - layers of reading,
  layers of writing. Social media is too raw - it’s all random snippets of text,
  no summaries. I need high-level views of the information, then the ability to
  zoom into the details. A ‘layer’ is a level of detail - and it includes both
  a measure of polish and quality, as well as a measure of intimacy with the
  topic or person.)//

I wonder about directories, linking, "browsing the internet" and so forth. This
is mainly directed at kicks, but I'd love to hear the whole group's thoughts as
well.

Kicks, do you ever deal with information overload? Like, you're browsing and
surfing and discovering personal websites and interesting articles and now
you've got 10, 15, 20 tabs<<footnote "tb" "100s?!??!">> open and they all seem
like cool rabbit holes and you're not quite sure where to go next? Or what it
all means anymore? (maybe that's just me.)

---
@kickscondor / 2019-12-10

I have experienced this in the past - and I still experience this with books.
Although I’m not sure it’s the same. What I experience is //gah, I’m not
spending enough time reading all the things I want to read, finding all the
things I want to discover, given how much there is!!// And I assume that’s what
people mean when they say ‘information overload’. (Your image of so many tabs.)

Is it actually ‘overload’? Or is it that there is infinite information (and
there was a century ago) and you’re feeling some inability to approach it?

  Which, in my case, has usually been about losing my discipline for a time span.

  But I am spending the right amount of time reading online right now - and I have
  a very long list to work through that is in a sensible order. (I no longer have
  tabs open - I do have a link list, so that has helped.) I am not spending enough
  time reading books.

If I spend enough hours each week, I feel like I am at least
methodically working through the infinite mass and I feel healthy.
---
@sphygmus / 2019-12-07

Does curation help? Like -- you're
specifically looking for cool people doing cool things in obscurity and you want
to let us folks in your corner of the world know -- so does the endless array of
cool people doing cool things feel overwhelming or invigorating or? (I get the
sense it might be the opposite, that you feel like it's hard to find cool people
doing cool things. correct me here!)

  This is also what helped get me into h0p3 (and you and chamy, because you follow the same conventions): because you clearly mark dated, temporary notes vs longer, central nodes or essays. So it is very easy to know where to ‘start’. Which is appreciated when I am discovering someone and want to move from the polished stuff down to the day-to-day stuff.
  How much time do you spend hiking down rabbit holes? When do you know when to
  stop? Do you have dedicated sessions to browsing, where you just wander and
  earmark links for later? What makes you earmark a site to share -- just that it
  makes you go "cool!" or is there something else? How much time do you spend
  digging around in a site before you give it the yay or nay? Is there a sort of
  qualitative "this site meets x qualities I'm looking for" or is it much more
  subjective than that? 
  ---
  @kickscondor / 2019-12-10

  I do wish I was aware of more black writers. I know there is a tendency to do
  this out of guilt or political activism. But I simply feel like black writers
  have an unusual angle. I think this is why black artists are popular in
  mainstream culture - subconsciously we know that they are outliers and can show
  us what it means to be human in a totally unexpected way. I mean I am definitely
  interested in anyone out there, regardless of their race - but among Americans,
  I think black artists have shown that they are always on the avant garde of
  cultural movements.

  So, at the same time, it is difficult to find certain subcultures that you may
  want to find. (I would also love to find a really sweet fitness goth blog.
  Especially if it was a .onion site.)

  @sphygmus / 2019-12-07

  are you casting wide nets or deep nets? and does this relate to the connection
  vs depth you mentioned in your letter? this is where fraidycat comes in, I
  think -- to keep an eye on a large net of people without ingesting everything
  they create. How do you avoid FOMO with what they're creating? deal with knowing
  there's ''so much'' out there that it's impossible to keep up with everything
  //and// read all the great classics? (again, does curation help with that
  feeling?)

  yeah! and not just browsing, I'm also curious about how all this relates to
  articles you read, newsletters you're subscribed to -- how much of it do you
  keep up with? how much of it do you let go of?

    re-watching your most recent fraidycat video, perhaps that's just my answer -- a
    simple overview you use to keep tabs on people (but then I still wonder about
    depth; where do you dig in?).
    ---
    @kickscondor / 2019-12-10

    When I do find someone that I really really REAALLY connect with - then I
    greedily spam that link wherever I can - in my notes, into Fraidycat, I
    recite it in my mind. I am so afraid of losing it. And it means that I begin
    to visit that site very frequently, to try to read everything that I can.
    When I found [[Ton’s blog|https://www.zylstra.org/blog/]], it was like that.
    And I was very appreciative that I could tell which posts were ephemeral and
    which were polished, finalized essays.

---
@kickscondor / 2019-12-10

It’s so cool to me that you care to ask me a question like this! That, alone,
makes me feel like there are plenty of ‘cool people doing cool things’. Even if
it was just you and me - that would be enough.

No, I feel like there are many more cool people than I can possibly be aware of.
I worry sometimes that I have no sensibility. I honestly find something amazing
in almost everyone I discover. If they are working in hypertext, it feels like
I can count on it. And yeah – it’s invigorating.

@sphygmus / 2019-12-15

I know I've been drawn to people who appear to be on a mission because I'm
unconsciously hunting for what I perceive them to have -- maybe by learning
enough from them I learn what piece is missing from me, maybe if I absorb
enough of their work the spark will rub off and I'll have a mission too.

It's hard to imagine being someone who's not hunting for a mission in others
but who has found and is pursuing the answer to the point where it spills out
so much and attracts others who were where I used to be.

I'm at the point where writing those paragraphs feels almost like that's just
a story I'm still telling myself; that I'm on the brink of ''knowing'' and
''doing'' -- like I'm telling myself I don't know where I'm going and another
part of me is giving me a massive side-eye like //yo, really? just stop
fibbing because you feel afraid, because of maybe and what if and but I could
fail.//

  ---
  @sphygmus / 2019-12-15

  My answer might change if the risk was immediately impacting me. If I ever
  stop writing in this wiki, perhaps I've come face to face with danger that has
  forced me to stop publishing it for my own safety. Depending on what that
  might be, I hope I've got enough supplies around to locally self-host my wiki
  on my computer. (xavier, I'll use you as a server if I have to. (`<insert
  afternoon researching home servers/NAS>`))

  This question is more oriented at the //public// angle of the self-modelling,
  right? As my animal-brain doesn't feel any risk presently, it's worth it to
  engage in this hyperconversation with you and kicks and chamy. When I have
  //felt// risk (real or not), I tend to retreat from the public side, feel it
  out more. I'm not letting go of this wiki, though, or my journals, or the
  random text files on my desktop. I've heard artists describe it being
  impossible for them to //not// draw or doodle or sketch -- I feel that with my
  writing; I pause at times but I don't think I could actually go cold-turkey
  from writing for an extended period of time. Writing is something I //have//
  to do. Its publicity is just a side effect of writing letters to h0p3 in a
  wiki.

  @sphygmus / 2019-12-15

  I've hardened my private wiki server to the best of my ability, but someone
  could probably get into it if they were really trying. It should be pretty
  separate from important offline accounts, though, so I don't know what good
  that would do them.

  Threats... well, depends on the threats, I suppose? I never frequented the
  chans or chatrooms or any of the other ways people are exposed to internet
  dickery; probably the worst experience I've had with other people online
  would be dumb or otherwise annoying responses to my occasional reddit posts.
  I assume this means I don't have the thick skin developed by y'all who
  frequented those spaces. 

  I'm in no way prepared for physical endangerment, whether the source of that
  violence is my wiki or some other aspect of my online life. I often feel
  endangered by people I don't know from AD when I'm driving down the highway,
  though, so the likelihood of physical violence being triggered by <<sus>>
  feels inconsequential in comparison.<<footnote "nt" "but I walked 40 minutes

  @sphygmus / 2019-12-15

  I think that depends on how my wiki has grown in a decade! Perhaps by then
  I've done something to address the question that gwern poses: //"what on this
  massive highly-interlinked website might I want to start reading?"//

  I probably wouldn't know that a million people were deepreading my wiki at
  first. Is there discussion happening about it? Where is the discussion
  happening? Unless it gets mentioned by us hypertexters, I might miss it
  (although if it happened in places that send web mentions, I would receive
  and notice those).

  I expect I would feel overwhelmed and scared at first, then curious to see
  what people were saying and why they were reading my wiki and what parts of
  my wiki they were reading, offended at what appears to me as
  misinterpretations, thrilled at seeing people making new and unexpected
  connections.

  lives in driving distance of both of us.

    @sphygmus / 2019-12-15

    I often walk past a truck in the parking garage at work with a thin blue
    line sticker on its rear windshield. Who else at my workplace harbors
    beliefs similar to the person you mention? I'm probably more in danger from
    the locals around me than from people who know you.

  Even you [[kicks]], low-profile as you are in some respects, many people find
  you perplexing, and I know some who straight-up don't like you just because you
  are weird (I take it to be my job to vouch and reason with them about the value
  of [[other]]ness and uniqueness).

  What do you want my wiki and [[RGM]] to become to protect you?
  ---
  @chameleon / 2019-12-12 19:23 CST

  Keep my real name in your meat-memory and your meat-memory alone, along with
  anything that can reasonably lead to me or my loved ones' real name, location,
  place of work, etc. being discovered by a motivated individual.
  ---
  @sphygmus / 2019-12-15

  I don't have a good answer to this question. From my perspective, you've
  already taken the steps that make me feel more protected, and I don't know
  what else there is to do!

---
@chameleon / 2019-12-12 19:23 CST

Minimal, imo. I've been friends with much more dangerous individuals than the
types that are likely to stumble across my wiki; and the wiki isn't really
connected to my irl identity anyways apart from some vague gesturings towards
locations, and even then I'm likely to just be lost in the crowd. The worst that
will happen is that people will point and laugh, and I can take that.

  And hey, at the risk of sounding edgy, I can defend myself. Your white
  supremacist buddy, if he can even find me (he can't) will be enjoying a bullet
  in his dome if he ever comes near me.

  Besides that, I'm not terribly interesting and thus wouldn't make a very good
  target. The narcissistic focus of the wiki betrays the fact that I'm actually
  rather boring and milquetoast; I'm barely even politically active besides
  doing my civic duty of voting.

---
@sphygmus / 2019-12-15

It varies for all of us, I'm sure. This wiki is 100% vulnerable to doxxing.
Elsewhere, my life leaks everywhere, and I fail to contain it. I'm trying to be
better about compartmentalizing different arenas from each other, using multiple
usernames where before I used one username everywhere. But I don't want to kid
myself either -- the tracking corporations have fingerprinted my browser and my
browsing patterns and probably collect enough data know when I hit a web page
even when I've traveled across the country. At this point, after being on the
internet for 13 years (exactly half my life right now), I can't go back and
start fresh again with no fingerprint, so I can only aim to do my best (and fail
at even that).
---
@h0p3 / 2019-12-12 15:55 EST

Anyway, aside, one thing I like about our [[hyperconversation]], including this
more focused groupchat-style: it feels like I'm sitting in the same room with
you all rabbitholing where we please, often well beyond the surface.
---
@sphygmus / 2019-12-23

I'd like to propose this question as our next point of conversation:

<<<
//"what on this massive highly-interlinked website might I want to start
reading?"//
<<<

    @chameleon / 2020-01-12 17:15 CST

    Where do you start? [[Root]]? The tag list?

    What are you looking for?

    Can I provide it?

      @h0p3 / 2020-01-17 15:18 EST

      I think that's the real issue. We get to be librarians about ourselves
      for [[others]]. It's a human that picks it out at least sometimes, even
      if assisted by some crucial cataloging strategies and search tools. I'm
      convinced we serve up who we are to others in a way they can wander on
      their own, but we also serve as a live-ish helpdesk to our own [[PSM]]s.
      A librarian has to interview the user to understand what they need or
      want. You provide some one-size-fits-all approaches, and then you are
      well-positioned to work on the exceptions.

    I don't know. Inspired by kicks' and h0p3's comments, I wrote
    [[ReadMe|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#ReadMe]]. Maybe that'll provide some
    direction. Maybe it'll just confuse the travelers even more.

kicks, I think you already address this in your FILE_ID pop-up -- would you say
more about how you thought about what to put there?
---
@kickscondor / 2020-01-05

Well, that file is kind of my personal website, but it’s hidden inside of a
little square. I like my site to be disorienting to happen upon, because I
think it demands a bit of curiosity as an admission fee. (I think you do this
too with your KEEP OUT notebook. It has lips on it, which soften the sting.)

  @h0p3 / 2020-01-26 14:27 EST

  Yup! =). You are inviting, and your price is gentle. You reward degrees of
  curiosity. It generates valuable chatter, imho; some connections being
  stronger than others. I think you initiate the [[T42T]] handshake in making
  it available, but the funnel or steps for cooperation usefully bounces
  trolls, [[MOPs|https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths]], vampires, and
  those who aren't interested in a fair commitment. In contrast, there's often
  a darker vertigo factor and blood sacrifice to speak with me at length
  (beyond pleasantries). I appreciate your lightness in this regard.
  ---
  @kickscondor / 2020-01-05

  But I’m so big on directories - it occured to me that I could evolve the
  ‘pinned post’ into something like a mini-directory. h0p3’s ‘root’ page is much
  more detailed - it’s five pages in one - and each page is terrifically long. I
  just tried to think about what a mini-directory or cover page would look like.

  I also like to hide it because talking about myself is very uncomfortable. I
  feel very insignificant - but I like it that way - to have to feel that my own
  ideas or personality or opinions are very valuable - that would be too much to
  handle. I’d rather have little ideas and wrong ideas of my own - and just be a
  random person living life and no need to size up what I’m saying against the
  great ideas of history - no need to establish some track record of being right
  or upstanding.<<footnote "k:[3]" "Although I do get caught up in the allure of
  cultural commentary and trying to articulate a perspective that, in the moment,
  might feel ‘right’ - I only hope these are taken as good fun and not as
  objective truth.">>

  So sometimes I think about getting rid of it - it seems like an advertisement
  for myself. But I hold out hope that I can make it a mini-directory and
  eliminate the self-promotional aspects. (On the other hand, I want to encourage
  other people to self-promote, so I don’t know why I see it as so shameful to
  write that way - when I like for other people to do it.)
  ---
  @h0p3 / 2020-01-26 14:27 EST

  I often feel like your goal is to help people feel comfortable being
  themselves, celebrating being human, and cutting through some of the
  attitudes which have arisen in the market dynamics of the commodified web.
---
@sphygmus / 2019-12-23

This is something I did a little bit in the //very// first iteration of
\/\/sphygm.us that I published -- sort of an index page that linked to
projects -- but not something that really exists on my site right now. h0p3,
your Root seems to serve this purpose in a brief way right now? Chamy, it looks
like you address this in a way with linked tags in your Root.

Are there things us wikis could be doing to better serve readers? Is it
important for us to attempt to provide something like this for readers? Should
it look like Gwern's index, or is there a more wiki-native solution that might
be more ideal?
---
@kickscondor / 2020-01-05

I don’t know - the thing I’ve really enjoyed about your public wikis is that
I’ve had to learn your conventions before getting into them. I think you
require something from your readers - and I think that sets up a really
healthy relationship that the rest of the Internet has struggled with. It’s
not their place; it’s yours. And that’s abundantly clear. But when I became
comfortable in your wiki, you may have trusted that I had done sufficient
work to be worth interacting with.

  But then again, I like funneling and there would be no cone without the
  point. Yours is a static image - but it’s also the colored tags to the side.
  I think you set the right mood for what it is you’re doing. Sometimes I wish
  I was structured more like a wiki - but stylistically I’m trying to evoke a
  turn of the century blog - and aesthetic is important to me, because it
  surrounds everything else. It accomplishes something that can’t be expressed
  or done any other way.

---
@h0p3 / 2019-12-25 / 2019.12.01%20-%20Antipleonasm%20Analysis%3A%20Telic%20Drafting

Reading this wiki is far too much work. Surely, there are so many more pleasant
things to do with your life. Why start at all? Lol.
---
@kickscondor / 2020-01-05

Yeah, ok - let’s get into this. What has really inspired me about all of your
wikis - and some of the newer personal websites I’ve run into - is this
layering of the hypertext. h0p3 has the ‘about’ page, people might have a
timeline or a ‘now’ page on their site, even Twitter with its ‘pinned post’ -
you don’t just have to have a blog that drops you into chronological posts.
---
@h0p3 / 2019-12-25 / 2019.12.01%20-%20Antipleonasm%20Analysis%3A%20Telic%20Drafting

Of course, I do not have a practical answer which is satisfactory for this one.
I would like to know how to give a simple, linear, and almost cut-and-dry
answer to that question in the various contexts that matter. I'm particularly
awful at determining which doorways are most valuable for a given person+time
or even the average person. Additionally, what I consider most [[salient]]
about the site is likely not what most people do, and we can all be wrong for
various reasons about that.

  @h0p3 / 2019-12-25 / 2019.12.01%20-%20Antipleonasm%20Analysis%3A%20Telic%20Drafting

  Sometimes, I think that question is really
  intending to ask instead: Who do you want your readers to be?
  <<footnotes "i" "I am open to the possibility that machine-assisted reading
  of this wiki (beyond the fact that it's already a digital medium) will be
  necessary. Crazy as it sounds, I remain open to the possibility that a
  non-human intelligence will //read// it as well.">> Why do
  you want them to read it? I think there's a difference between what someone
  would want to read and what they ought; I'm interested in the former only in
  virtue of the latter. <<footnotes "a" "Reason #23490834 this wiki will not be
  read by almost anyone.">>

There are some places that tend to be more relevant than others. [[Readme]] is
something every new reader should read, but the issue of where best to "start"
is something that anyone can reasonably ask, including me on any given day
(and, that is what I take myself to be doing, [[WINTCIS]]). While I grant there
is a set of correct (or ranked in terms of relevance) answers in a given
context (or maxim), I can't say I know how to put my finger on it well enough.
If I did, I would have solved some fundamental problems in moral philosophy.

Like any particular perspective in the world, a site ought not treat everything
equally in all cases. The goal, on average, I take it, is to pick out in relief
what matters most instead of flattening it. That is a crazy hard problem.
---
@kickscondor / 2020-01-05

I’m starting to think of it as
//funneling//, having layers of hypertext that become progressively more
personal, or which become more detailed, or perhaps even more (or less)
ephemeral as you go through the layers.

  I think part of this is an evolution of the fragmentation that has happened in
  social networks. People may use Twitter for a certain self-image or community,
  then Facebook or a blog for another mode, and people have become very
  accustomed to using each network as a separate outlet. And there’s a nice
  advantage to this - because you can address groups differently and not expose
  certain groups to overly personal material or control the image you project in
  each network.

  In a similar way, I see this with Nadia Eghbal’s site - she has a newsletter
  for offering a monthly summary of her work, or there is the blog where you can
  read essays when they are published, and then she has a raw
  [[notes|https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes/]] page that isn’t tied to any
  notification system (like RSS even), so you have to go out of your way to visit
  the page to catch anything new. So rather than having separate networks, there
  are different avenues to how you can approach her work.

Your wikis accomplish these layers using titling conventions. Usually ephemeral
stuff is marked with a date, letters marked with ‘@’, permanent content is
plainly titled. But this is also related to your front page material - you all
know where to hide on your wikis the more personal material that you post and
how to surface the things that are more central to your dialogue with the rest
of us. (Sphygmus’ page coloring is a very interesting approach here.)

So I think of this as a kind of inverted funnel - where you have these entry
points to your wiki - might be an ‘about’ page or it might be one of your
sidebar directories or some intermediate topical page - and pages are situated
somewhere in this conical area, perhaps you are even aware of how far a page
might be from the doorway when you post it. Or which series of doorways reach
it.

  (//I’m wondering what you think about this concept - what I’ve got wrong or if
  I’m characterizing your process correctly.//)
  ---
  @h0p3 / 2020-01-17 15:18 EST

  It's difficult for me to know what it is like for the reader. I work for that
  linearity, layering, funneling, and hierarchy. I see structures which emerge
  or jut out of the ball of chaos. My assumption is that a wanderer is forced
  into exploring and seeing themselves positioned relative to roads they've
  been down, and that gets tricky with such a non-linear ball.

---
@sphygmus / 2020-01-06

The inverted funnel is also a fun metaphor because hey, it kinda looks like an
iceberg! And our wikis are kinda like icebergs, with the daily logs all deep
and underneath, and misc bits in the sidebar sticking out of the surface of the
water.

  @h0p3 / 2020-01-17 15:18 EST

  A higher and higher percentage of my wiki is a log each passing month.
  Eventually, the iceberg is mostly of one kind of ice. The entrances and
  skeleton can't be logs though. 

---
@h0p3 / 2019-12-25 / 2019.12.01%20-%20Antipleonasm%20Analysis%3A%20Telic%20Drafting

Some kinds of things, by their very nature, are difficult to uncover, reveal, or
give a clean structure to (and that can never be completely accomplished by the
[[fff]]). The question is so striking to me because I'm trying to ask and
answer that question about the world itself inside this wiki (including this
wiki). What on this massive highly-interlinked ~~website~~ ~~internet~~ in the
world might I want to start ~~reading~~ investigating and thinking about? This
wiki is as generalized a model as I can make it; I take your question to imply:
what is worth reading out in the world? At least in part, what's relevant in
this site as it relates to what is outside the site? That must sound like woo,
hogwash, a complete fucking non-answer.
<<footnotes "u" "Feel free to argue I take my work and myself far too
seriously too.">> I wish I could give you a
better one, but that is very much what this site-vessel's metamodern structure
is pointing toward through the pomo flooding chaotic sea of meanings.
<<footnotes "e" "This is a place where I must //show// and not just //tell//.
While the wiki is a pile, I am proud of //why// it's a pile in this respect.
Arguably, there's a way in which I do a decent job of demonstrating how hard
it is to answer that philosophical question in a generalized fashion (it's
downright a Continental Analytic hybrid, a mix of technical definitions and
structures with the wandering subjectivity narrative, as qualitative and
quantitative as I can make it). In addition, I don't think I'm preserving
[[an entire universe|2018.08.23 - Josiah: Tiff?]], but I do see myself as
trying to preserve an evolving set of perspectives, and there's an
[[infinigress]] to being meta about or having yet another functional
perspective on [[other]] perspectives (even versions of oneself).">>


Even Wikipedia, a somewhat homogeneous appearing site, in a sense, ends up
being something the reader must search (and not everything on Wikipedia is
equally valuable). I don't see a reason to think my own wiki shouldn't be
similar beyond a set of entrances that attempt to describe my protocols and
overall approach. [[Root]], [[Readme]], and the sidebar are the best starting
places I know of (hence why they are essentially the front page); I use them
too. You have to bring prior intentional material (and the more consciously
aware of it you are the better) to the table to figure out what to make of the
wiki in the right order.

  I have a range of people who have taken a look, and I usually end up pointing
  to at least slightly different parts of my wiki, [[WINTCIS]]. One thing I
  refrain from doing much at all is marking for [[others]] what I think is
  relevant for them in this pile (though this is slowly changing over time, I
  would argue). I tend to do so in direct conversation where we both have skin in
  the game. I prefer we pick out the [[salience]] for us (and perhaps beyond)
  together. It is likely the case that a reader is best served by writing with
  me. You need to ride me like a sherpa-donkey on the pukevat wasteland pile of a
  telic cannon.
  <<footnotes "l" "Assuming you trust me (and likely even if you didn't), at
  some point, live interaction with [[The Other]] is the most energy-efficient
  empirical method; eventually, passively reading for the same information is
  far more expensive both in terms of how much must be read and how much must
  be simulated.">>

  I [[hope]] in time to eventually have a much cleaner hierarchical/tree answer
  (though, I suggest it will always be a steep climb in some areas). I don't know
  well enough what it will look like way down the instrumental road. 

---
@chameleon / 2020-01-12 17:15 CST

The iceberg/inverted funnel idea is lovely. My wiki is a dungeon in the depths
already, but that it goes so into the deep you may never return... that's a
scary thought, but fits the aesthetic!

When I first came across h0p3's wiki, I had intense vertigo. I knew there was
more there than I could ever read. I got scared. I fell back on twitter memes.
I hunted for reactionary sentiments so I could turn away. The abyss stared
back. I'm very glad he wrote me, and that I was able to reply. I'm very glad I
have the wiki. I'm a different person now, a better person for it, in my
opinion. I like to think I'm one of the good ones™.
---
@sphygmus / 2020-01-06

When doing my audits recently I've
been thinking of it in terms of linking, and distance from discovery (kind of
like 6 Degrees of Sphygmus). Some tiddlers are only linked to by one or two
others and are more distant from the surface in that way. The tiddlers with one
or maybe two links are actually more hidden than the "real" orphans -- at least
those get their [[own section|$:/core/ui/MoreSideBar/Orphans]].

  @h0p3 / 2020-01-17 15:18 EST

  Yeah, that has to be one of the most interesting issues in reasoning about the
  wiki structure.  What's really important may pop up there. How should things
  cluster together? What does it mean to efficiently find what is relevant? The
  bigger the wiki gets, the more I'm forced to use the search tools, and the less
  I can navigate it like a directory. Eventually, even I will likely be forced to
  use more dynamic tooling to navigate ad hoc directory structures in my own wiki
  with the kin-based [[Locator]]. 
  ---
  @sphygmus / 2020-01-06

  My //on this day// tiddler also surfaces them without context other than the
  particular day they were created, so the more distantly linked tiddlers might
  appear there. The older my dated entries are, the more links they're buried
  behind (log collection > yearly audit > monthly audit > dailies), while the
  topical tiddlers are pretty high up (either linked directly in my sidebar or
  one layer below).

    @chameleon / 2020-01-12 17:15 CST

    hm. Some of my tiddlers, too, are buried by time. I use the search bar when
    writing a //previously.// Even I'm starting to forget what I have buried in
    here. Ultimately, it does provide a good resource. I've more than once
    forgotten some minutiæ, gone back through the logs, and found it again.
    ---
    @sphygmus / 2020-01-06

    I think I like that this means the older journal entries will "fade" in terms
    of linking layers. People have to be at least somewhat nosy to poke around in
    the older daily logs. (unless they're looking at //on this day// ofc.)
---
@kickscondor / 2020-01-05

I think the biggest discovery that I’ve made with ‘funneling’ is to have my
/all unfiltered page<<footnotes "k:[1]" "containing the raw edits, essays, links
and so on">> and then to have a main page<<footnotes "k:[2]" "expressly made of
things I want to broadcast on the surface, on the home page.">>.
To describe it in TiddlyWiki
terms, it’s as if I’ve taken my ‘recent’ sidebar and curated it on the home
page. And, rather than using titling conventions to do it, I use metadata - so
that some entries are marked ‘hidden’ or ‘draft’ and that keeps them off the
home page.
---
@chameleon / 2020-01-12 17:15 CST

Kicks, I forget where, but I made the distinction before: tiddlers VS articles
VS journals. Tiddlers are the superset, and articles are subject to the
[[Development Levels]]. Journal
entries are fleeting things. They will be lost in time if not tagged, but
they're still there beneath the surface.

  @h0p3 / 2020-01-17 15:18 EST

  I think almost everyone agrees with you here. I don't think it's an easy
  problem. Like, if the story of our lives is really just ephemeral, if
  re-using our data doesn't matter, then why write them down (or, rather, why
  keep them and catalog them, why search through them?)? I re-use some
  percentage of my journal entries in different ways (beyond [[Know Thyself]]),
  and I don't know which ones are going to be important up front. What's good
  log-keeping in computing? I don't know.

  I like your developmental levels. Perhaps when (''if'', who am I kidding? ;P) I
  get to [[The Remodeling]] again, I'll work toward that in a field. There's
  something to it. If tiddlers are atoms, I want to know what kinds of project
  molecules should be assigned development levels and so forth (beyond what I
  have in [[Hub]]). I have no idea what I'm doing on this front, as usual. =)
  ---
  @chameleon / 2019-12-22 / Tiddlers%2C Journal Entries%2C and Articles

  I've used these terms a bit hap-hazardly but I think now I can define them more
  clearly.

  A tiddler is the raw page unit on tiddlywiki. This is a tiddler. [[Root]] is a
  tiddler. [[2019.09.27 - Islandpunk]] is a tiddler.

  An article is a non-journal tiddler that uses the [[Development Levels]]
  system. So [[The Last Waifuist]] is an article, but [[2019.12.10 - roguelikes
  and OSR]] is not.

  A journal entry is tagged [[Journal]] and begins with a date in the usual
  format (YYYY.MM.DD on my wiki). So [[2019.10.28 - chame writes a half-decent
  progression!?]] is a journal entry, [[h0p3]] is not.

  The distinction can be thought of thusly: "tiddler" is like "book"; "article"
  is like "novel" or "encyclopedia"; "journal entry" is like "diary". A novel is
  a book, a diary is a book, but a novel is not a diary.
---
@kickscondor / 2019-12-24

^now^ I think there is something about ‘now’ which I think is important. We can’t
satisfy the modeling of ourselves in a moment (‘now’), but we can try to develop
something over time.
---
@h0p3 / 2019-12-25

^sliver^ From what I can tell, there is a fuzzy sliver of time in the pregnant
present; it doesn't vanish into a single point. We can take developmental
ticktock steps (though I know not how small nor what it means to divide
them) toward something in the "now," and there, insofar as those tiny
timeslices and gunky fragments yet afford us choice (sometimes we are
only an observer), there is an opportunity for fitting satisfaction in
context. I think it's terrifying, often absurd.
---
@kickscondor / 2020-01-21

Ok, thank you - the answers about ‘funneling’ or ‘iceberging’ or ‘shitpiling’
or whatever you want to call it are all really interesting. I really like
chame’s take on drafting as [[another layer|Development Levels]].
I hadn’t considered that kind of granularity at all.

I guess we can start to wind the discussion down.
---
@sphygmus / 2020-01-28 / %40%3A hypertext 2020%3A feelings %26 wires

As we're winding up the discussion here: I think it's important to not slide by
the potential for each of us as individuals to experience feelings of being
scared or left out or noticed or ignored or exposed -- simply, feelings in
general. Said feelings arise in many social contexts (not just this one), and
the medium of "hypertext"/"hyperconversation" is far from a perfect solution to
our social frictions and triggers.

All of this reminds me of a redditor's comment about h0p3's wiki:

<<<
[O]f course your voluminous wiki is 100% a facade in the sense that you've
curated every entry, every word, the aesthetic, the diction and prose. The
images and colors.

They are all a performance, like our outfits and mannerisms. We are presenting
ourselves as characters to the world. 

What you're not including is how similar to the rest of us you are. You too
fart and ache like us.
<<< a [[reply|https://old.reddit.com/r/FamiliesYouChoose/comments/cbnbpv/33yo_american_madman_pseudonymous_wiki_penpal/etj5wmd/]] to [[h0p3's comment|https://philosopher.life/#Le%20Reddit%20Log%3A%20Jibberjabber]]<<footnote "lnk" "where I wish I could link to a specific section of internal text">>

which is fascinating to me because h0p3 is ''very explicit'' about including
his farts and aches in his wiki! (For
[[example|https://philosopher.life/#Smelting%20Muh%20Silly%20Farts%3A%20%F0%93%82%BA]]!)

  And of course the worry in this quote has been brought up in [[@: hypertext
  2020]]<<footnote "see" "> Are we modeling fictional characters or not? Does it
  matter?">> and in the letters kicks & h0p3 have written, and almost certainly
  elsewhere in our threads as well.<<footnote "cc" "please correct me if it's not
  the same worry at all!">>

From my perspective, this worry about "projecting a facade" or "putting on a
mask" is a worry about our extended lack of phenomenological contact with the
qualia of others. That is, in a face-to-face conversation I have the experience
of seeing and participating in another person's outward expressions of emotion
(laughing, frowning, body language, tone of voice). The true connection between
the other's //internal state// and their //external emotions// aside, I still
experience a sense of physical, embodied, and emotional feedback which leads me
to believe I am experiencing a true expression of their internal state.

  The internet, our websites, and our conversations over/through them completely
  remove and de-sync this feedback, and that disconnect triggers our unconscious
  to start worrying about whether we are actually receiving the truth of others'
  internal states.<<footnote "ag" "this also gets brought into discussions of
  trolling and online bullying -- a lack of feeling the consequences of one's

    Yeah.<<footnote "k:9" "Meaning: so good.">> I’m not at all against video or
    multimedia communication - I got into Snapchat for awhile. I just want to
    find the strength in hypertext writing. It seems hasty to me to give up
    after 20 years in (10 for most people). We have a lot to learn about
    reading and writing online.<<footnote "k:10" "And may not be able to - so I
    understand anyone who wants to bail on it.">>

    I think there’s a yearning for the return of text. Video and audio now
    dominate - and have serious issues, too. I think part of this comes from so
    much of human history being tied up in text - perhaps this lends a ‘sacred’
    feeling to text - but it’s also that it isn’t as tied up with physical
    performance and is able to be ingested internally in a way. I’m seeing more
    people writing about what they’re reading and challenging themselves to
    read more - it’s still seen as a virtue in people’s minds.

      @h0p3 / 2020-02-10 19:42 EST

      I'm learning to appreciate connecting with lots of methods. I'm grateful
      that you reason about the limits of this particular practice in a
      semi-purist fashion with us. I still take writing to be critical to (and
      arguably the hardest part of) relationships. Usually, I encounter the
      opposite problem: why would anyone pay attention to what I have to say on
      my wiki (and write back) when they can use more immediately gratifying
      mediums with lower barriers to entry that are considered (by social norm)
      to be more ephemeral (though, I find this word baffling), low-key, and
      non-committal? I don't think most people who might read as closely as you
      often do would want to remain so remote (not the right word, but I don't
      know the right one) either, so you are somewhat like a control testing
      group perspective to stand out against the other relationships I have
      which are mixed.<<footnote "h:wam" "We have very few exceptions to
      communicating over anything other than our sites.">> Sometimes I think we
      are like two scientists mutualistically studying different problems
      together over a series of tubes. What we have doesn't match the
      consistent revelatory and self-modeling work which [[Sphygmus]] and
      [[chameleon]] engage in; they are more strongly integrated into my daily
      life. I adore that writing is the centerpiece for our
      communication,<<footnote "h:foc" "In a way, we've overshot the golden
      mean toward the much rarer side of vice. It's fascinating.">> but
      diversity in expression is still valuable. My assumption is that if and
      when you want to connect further, you will. Until then, I think it's good
      to enjoy what we have.

    I guess I feel like asking all of you: looking at self-modeling as a type
    of permanent serialization format, where you’re attempting to prematurely
    get frozen (cryogenically), what medium(s) would be your chosen form of
    carbonite?
    ---
    @h0p3 / 2020-02-10 19:42 EST

    I'm assuming the metaphor isn't meant to be taken too strongly here, and
    you can correct me if I'm wrong about that.<<footnote "h:wat" "You know me,
    I'm nitpicky: why should I think I am attempting to //prematurely// get
    frozen? I agree I'm trying to learn how to create immutable aspects of
    objects [[irwartfrr]], not prematurely though. Serialization^^tm^^ still
    doesn't describe it correctly.">> The wiki is still my chosen medium, but
    it captures, enables, or replicates a lot of mediums and methods. Long-form
    writing is also still the pinnacle to me, although I have a harder time
    knowing what doesn't count as long-form in here. I capture a lot of stories
    and thoughts in this horcrux-pensieve. Sometimes, larger, evolving,
    emerging, or meta stories about those timeslices arise. 

    If we are going sci-fi for mediums, at least for the foreseeable future,
    it's not clear that ML will become energy-efficient enough to do anything
    more than augment this medium; there are, however, possible mediums which
    are significantly better for self-modeling. To be clear, however, I'm not
    looking directly for those methods which are best at self-modeling given
    unlimited resources without deontic constraints. One of my preferences is
    to use a self-owned medium which the average joe can replicate to some
    extent, [[WINTCIS]]. In terms of infrastructure, text is energy-efficient,
    flexible, easier to compute over, cheap to store in decentralized fashions,
    and something which even the poor kid in India could achieve on their
    shitty Android phone (though, obviously, that is still severely
    limited).<<footnote "h:sap" "It reminds me of //Apollo 13//, where we have

  @kickscondor / 2020-02-03

  Yeah.<<footnote "k:7" "Meaning: you’re saying great stuff - my actual

  I think this was a big part of my early letters to h0p3. Like: a total doubt
  that written communication could work. But it turned out to be really fun and
  rewarding - partially because it was so difficult and fraught with peril. So
  I find myself wanting to avoid corporeality with you all because I want to
  see how far this can go.<<footnote "k:8" "Hah, and maybe we’re at the end!">>

  @h0p3 / 2020-02-03 17:03 EST

  I'm slow to say we connect to someone's qualia^^tm^^ directly,<<footnote
  "h:sqd" "Even the conditions for experiencing qualia aren't something we can
  be certain about.">> but we can probably get closer to it. It's an empirical
  process, hence your reasonable doubt. We are blackboxes (even to ourselves to
  some extent), and that trusting trust problem cannot be solved all the way
  down. There's a [[faith]] in [[The Other]] problem which is never eliminated.

  While I will agree it exists, I don't know what that perfect (for the
  [[fff]]) solution entails, nor can I provide a perfect method for finding a
  solution (even accounting for our limitations). Communicating in-person often
  doesn't provide enough distance, and, likewise, communicating entirely
  remotely is usually too much distance. I agree we are wired for in-person
  encounters. There are significant privacy trade-offs here.  

  [[^encounters^]]

  The best solutions I've found are mixing communications channels. You'll find
  I aim to be formal or thorough in my letter-writing, but if you catch me at
  3am in IMing, I'm looser and more likely to shoot-the-shit. There comes a
  point in some of my relationships where voice is necessary; we simply can't
  communicate fast enough in writing. But, even my in-person encounters are
  fantastically augmented by having a wiki. I need them all to connect. Maybe
  conditions for feeling authenticity in connection are likely to vary on per
  person basis too.

  The Discord server may help us build more bridges. You can also call me
  whenever you want [[Sphygmus]]; I've never asked if I could call you because
  I'm already a creeper, lol. [[Kicks]] knows he can whenever he wants to, and
  [[chameleon]] has muh info now as well. I'm hoping to hear your voices (I
  need to walk while I talk).

So, does it matter whether we're receiving that feedback or not? How much is it
hardwired into our bodies to expect certain qualia and feel off balance without
it? What ways do we adjust for it over hypermedia? Could you make an argument
for the rise of forms like video/snapchat/tiktok as one attempt to solve the
qualia feedback problem?

Breaking it down in this way also highlights the overlap between our offline
and online interactions. A common worry online might be "is this person
scamming or catfishing me?" but the same worry can very much be had offline,
where, despite my unconscious belief of the feedback I'm receiving from another
person, I might also worry if they're scamming me. Perhaps similar worries will
have similar solutions? (And [[T42T]] enters the arena.)

I don't have any specific conclusions or questions for individuals! I just
wanted to highlight a dimension we hadn't directly discussed yet.

@h0p3 / 2020-02-03 17:03 EST

^encounters^ My encounters with someone in-person do not leave me clean images
that I can study later over the years; I'll only ever have fading and distorted
impressions. It's true that this problem doesn't actually disappear when I
have an external image to look at either, but some aspects are mitigated.
Conversely, real-time communications do not give much compute time for
cognitively finding collisions for deception.

@kickscondor / 2020-01-21

I think the last thing I
want to ask about touches on the ‘culture wars’ and the surrounding online
warfare that we find ourselves in.

  Specifically: the ingroup/outgroup dynamics
  that plague the Internet, the trolls and activists that stoke the fire, and the
  norms that are being established around how one should talk and write publicly.

  This is already a topic in the discussion - the personal/private distinction
  we’ve discussed indicates where we stand in defending ourselves, the topic of
  doorways into our icebergs is somewhat about who to invite and how to set the
  right note - and h0p3 just went into how the funnel can ‘bounce’ trolls and
  vampires. (Which troubles me, because I like to meet trolls and vampires, too.
  For sure I’d love to meet vampires! I’m not sure I want them to bounce as much
  as to rattle around inside.)
  ---
  @chameleon / 2020-01-26 17:01 CST: [[chameleon]]

  Part of the solipsistic nature of the wiki is that trolls don't really have
  much of an effect on it. I don't visit that side of the internet and I'd
  prefer to keep it that way. It's in public, but I could easily lock it down
  by using basic authentication or cryptography or whatever.

  I'd like to pre-emptively avoid lumping in "activists" with those types of
  people. My very existence is political in today's hyperpartisan world, and
  many of those "activists" are at least attempting to make the world a better
  place, even if I don't agree with their approach ([[not by
  half|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Cancel%2FCallout%20Culture]]). The only
  "activists" I'd shit on are those that appropriate the language of activism
  to perpetuate bigotry, i.e. TERFs and other second-wavers.

  Outside of just, y'know, ignoring them and focusing on my wiki, I exist in a
  true cozyweb too. 2dl has a gatekeeping system, and beyond that I exist in
  PMs and the like which (except with [[h0p3]]) generally stay ''private''
  messages. I've thought about starting a group chat, or even private mailing
  list. I appreciate the notion of staying under wraps. I love that "[[dark
  forest|https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1]]"
  analogy.

  @kickscondor / 2020-01-30

  Yeah, ok, I need to fill that in a bit. I’m not making a judgement here. I’m
  not putting them all in a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ category. There are good and bad
  trolls, good and bad activists.<<footnote "k:4" "I will say that I imagine
  that, like a craft or role, there are probably true experts and the rest of
  us are just playing, probably destructively. I think that’s the thing about
  trolls and activists. You have to have quality moves as well as real message.
  That’s asking a lot! I think it’s this thought, of ‘minions’ that operate in
  the ‘troll’ and ‘activist’ roles, that really make me think to group them
  together.">> (Although sometimes I wonder if centuries from now we’ll look
  back and see the pursuit for humor as being far more virtuous and generous
  than the pursuit for political ground. Maybe slightly - eh probably
  not.)<<footnote "k:5" "Also, could activists be more effective as trolls?
  While [[throwing|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM3nucc3XTc]] a shoe is
  activism, I think I have to score it in the troll camp.">>

  My grouping here is more a matter of directionality or something. Hypertext
  2010 was an effort in isolation - or solipsism, as you say - impossible to
  intrude upon (without hacking it) - so quite unsuitable for a troll or
  activist, whose fuel requires targets, people to trigger or people to sway.
  We don’t really have those directional targets. I mean I’m cool if people
  join us, but it’s not essential.

  In fact, I think, for me, the directionality is inverted. I’m here to read.
  I’m not trying to own or gather up a bunch of
  [[Winnie Lims|https://winnielim.org]]. I just want to
  read what she’s got and see what happens.<<footnote "k:6" "Like it’s a
  catalyst? Like it’s an unknown substance? What happens if I put THIS in the
  tank?">> Maybe I want to be owned and gathered. No, that’s not it - I mean
  perhaps in the moment of reading, I’m happy to be destroyed by it - but I’ve
  got my own thing I’m doing, it’s just going to be less dramatic. The
  directionality is just: I want to collect some of these cool stickers you’re
  offering. It’s like the pleasant capitalism that happens at the level of
  coins rather than cash.

  It’s possible that ‘hypertext 2020’ continues to be hermetic, ‘staying under
  wraps’. But, no, I think that while trying to articulate this directionality,
  I want that inverted movement. Perhaps it’s like a vacuum tube where the
  pressure got too hot. So now a hole broke and everything is getting sucked
  inside. It’s a nice breeze. Time to break some glass.

  Agreed on the mainstream - just on principle. My back is
  [[turned|https://www.kickscondor.com/flooding-the-culture]].

So this topic might kill the discussion - I feel like it’s more enjoyable to
just allude to the conflict rather than to take it on - not that no one’s
talking about it, it’s like everyone is talking about it all of the time. And I
think it goes without saying that the shape of our ‘cozyweb’ is due to these
forces.

I guess my question is: to what degree do you feel the four of us are being
shaped by the culture? Or are we attempting to reshape it in miniature? Because
‘hypertext 2020’ isn’t really a complete discussion without some vision for how
our smaller landscape could function. We have some good ideas for how the craft
of hypertext might progress in 2020. How can it possibly work culturally?

@h0p3 / 2020-01-26 14:27 EST

Those are big questions.

Outgrouping cannot be escaped online or offine, it can only be shaped. There
are no neutral parties or people devoid of ideology (even if a person may
describe themselves as such). Even attempting to avoid or calmly stand outside
of cultural war is an act of cultural warfare (though it may be the justified
move in some cases).
---
@chameleon / 2020-01-26 17:01 CST: [[chameleon]]

As much as possible, I want to negate, even escape, the ~culture~. I don't like
the mainstream 2010s-now-2020s internet. I hate twitter, I hate facebook, I
hate 99% of youtube, I hate instagram, and `<s>`i hate everyone that posts
there.`</s>`

If I had my way, we'd all forget the irony-poisoned, toxic,
proprietary-software cultural shit-show of today and use the infrastructure we
have to replicate and expand on what was good about the past. I want to see an
internet which is just about weird, funny shit again. I want communities which
are about sharing our love of something, not shitting on what someone else
likes, or gatekeeping each other for having insufficiently patrician taste. I
want an end to harassment; to reactionary bullying; to corporate shills and
#influencers. I want the internet to be fun again.

@h0p3 / 2020-01-26 14:27 EST

If I understand correctly, a cozyweb is a dialectical body designed with
infrastructural outgrouping. To varying [[dok]], it tends to shield itself from
the public and provides its users various control mechanisms for avoiding
conflict with most of the world (which is not the claim this is always
justified). Parts of what I'm engaged in here isn't toward the cozyweb because
it's too public (vulnerable and compromised even with pseudonymity), however,
the funnels do limit the probabilities of how the public might engage or react
to it.

Cultures are the dialectically ordered spheres of belief and desire of agents.
Beyond curiosity, I don't think there is anything particularly special about
them at first glance; lots of creatures have them. Ours are interesting because
we can be responsible for them (which I wouldn't say about, for example, a bee
culture).

  Hence, I am a culturalist; not all cultures of persons are morally
  equal. At the very least, some are permissible and some are not in various
  circumstances. 

  I don't know the degree to which each of us are shaped by "the culture" (which
  I presume to be the set of all cultures on the planet), and it's not easy to
  pick out what consists in "shaping." Someone can hold a gun to my head and say
  "jump or I shoot," and I'm still capable of choosing not to jump (even if I'm
  not politically free to do otherwise); that kind of freedom is what allows us
  to intervene upon how culture shapes us to some [[dok]]. We can react
  differently and choose not to assent. Unless we're thinking about a causally
  isolated agent with beliefs and desires (and perhaps not even then, depending
  on the nature of the agent), culture always shapes an agent to some [[dok]].
  Some influences are more direct or efficacious than others, and our
  responsibilities vary. 

How does it work culturally (as a description) is a different matter than how
it ought to work (as a prescription). Are the beliefs and desires of a culture
justified? I have doubts that we'll have a practice which is justifiable and
contagious at the same time. I am not convinced our work here will likely be of
any serious consequence at large, so the attempt is a Hail Mary pass (one I'm
obligated to attempt). There is work to do in improving the odds of success
though.
